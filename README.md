# Java-Lab-002

## Variables, Types and Operators

Be able to explain what variables are. Understand variable types, allowed names, and valid values.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.

### Part 1 - PricelessScript.java - [MasterCard YouTube Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_6stXKGuHo)

The lab template contains a program that prints the following:
```
2 tickets: $28.00
2 hotdogs, 2 popcorn, 2 sodas: $18.00
1 autographed baseball $45.00
real conversation with 11 year old son: priceless
true
```

Ignore the code that you don't fully recognize and concentrate on changing the variables to alter the MasterCard *Priceless* script to say:
```
3 tickets: $42.00
3 hotdogs, 3 popcorn, 3 sodas: $27.00
2 autographed baseball $90.00
watching the Giants win: priceless
false
```

### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
* Variable name
* People, Int, 3
* ticketPrice, Float 14.0f
* itemPrice, double, 9.0
* trueOrFalse, boolean, true or false


Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are *WRONG* and explain why.
* I don't know if this is examples from the program or from outside so I'll do both, ticketPrice the float I would assign as an integer because it doesn't have any need for a decimal point. Same goes with itemPrice
* Outside of the program you would want to have an "int x = 0.0" statement you would get an error. the same goes with "double y = 0" although your compiler would automatically convert the 0 to a double it's still improper formatting, I believe though a float is a number that can float between a double and an integer and be either one but I may be misremembering. 
* 

### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize *sout* and *String.format* to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Just as you did last week (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module), create a Spring2023 feature branch of your code
* Commit your working code to your local copy
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Spring2023 -> origin/Spring2023)
* Then issue a Pull request to my instructor branch
    * Make sure to save the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab.
